	'nihcp_notifications:notify:submit_request:body' => "Thank you for submitting a research proposal to the NIH Commons Cloud Pilot (https://datascience.nih.gov/commons/). We look forward to reviewing your application. You will be able to check the status of your application(s) in the portal at any time.

While review is underway, there are concrete steps you can preemptively take to speed the usability of cloud credits, if approved.  We propose the following steps, which may help accelerate your onboarding process if credits are provided.

	1. Consider your vendor options:  while you may have assembled your proposal with a particular vendor in mind, it may be worth considering if an alternative may be the most optimal choice, for price, service, or other reasons. Please see the providers and services menu on the portal.
	
	2. Identify your secondary surety:  the pilot requires that you provide a secondary surety to cover any overages (expenses in excess of credits provided). Both credit cards and purchase orders (POs) will work for this purpose.
	
	3. Review agreement needs:  if you are planning on using human subject data which you received from a covered entity (i.e., one with which you have a Business Associates Agreement  BAA), you may want to explore which vendor(s) already have an equivalent BAA with your home institute.  Negotiating a new BAA can be very lengthy.  In addition, you may want to review the standard account agreements of one or more providers to see if you and your home institution are comfortable with the terms and conditions.  Finally, if you require any form of Data Use Agreement with those who share your data, please take the time to create, update, or revise this document with the assistance of your institute’s General Counsel’s Office.
	
	4. Make a plan:  Credits expire 12 months from the data of distribution, so plan accordingly.  All unused credits will be forfeited.

After review is complete and if your credit request(s) are approved, you will be promptly to select the necessary credit allocation(s) from the cloud provider(s) of your choice in the portal. The cloud provider(s) you select will contact you directly to assist with the onboarding process. 

At the end of the one-year pilot, simply index any pledged Digital Objects (e.g. datasets, tools, etc.) in bioCADDIE (https://biocaddie.org/), and submit your feedback on the new funding model via the Post Implementation Report.

If you have questions during the process, please feel free to contact us at commons_credits@mitre.org or submit a help ticket through the portal. 

Sincerely,

Commons Credits Pilot Staff
