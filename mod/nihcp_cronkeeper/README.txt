NIHCP Cronkeeper
=========================

A simple plugin "intercepts" calls to the elgg cron page handler, and performs a security check.

Site admin can limit cron requests to local host, or specify a API key/value for remote access.  These can be modified in the plugin settings from the Administartion page.
